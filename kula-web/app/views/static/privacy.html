    <p>Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personally identifiable information or personally sensitive
        data through kulamart's public message boards, this information may be collected and used by others.</p>

    <p>kulamart encourages you to review the privacy statements of websites you choose to link to from kulamart so that
        you can understand how those websites collect, use and share your information. kulamart is not responsible for
        the privacy statements or other content on websites outside of the kulamart website.</p>

    <h3>Use of your Personal Information</h3>

    <p>kulamart collects and uses your personal information to operate its website(s) and deliver the services you have
        requested.</p>

    <p>kulamart may also use your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services
        available from kulamart and its affiliates. kulamart may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about
        your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered.</p>

    <p>kulamart does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties.</p>

    <p>kulamart may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering
        that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name,

    <h3>Use of Cookies</h3>

    <p>The kulamart website may use &quot;cookies&quot; to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a
        text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or
        deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in
        the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p>

    <p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a
        cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize
        kulamart pages, or register with kulamart site or services, a cookie helps kulamart to recall your specific
        information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as
        billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same kulamart website, the information
        you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the kulamart features that you customized.</p>

    <p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can
        usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may
        not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the kulamart services or websites you visit.</p>

    <h3>Security of your Personal Information</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>news and information</li>
